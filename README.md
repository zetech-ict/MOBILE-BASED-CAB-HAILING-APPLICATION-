# MOBILE-BASED-CAB-HAILING-APPLICATION-
Cab hailing is a model of renting vehicles for short periods of time, where the payment is made according to the time and distance effectively travelled. Carsharing offers a simple, economical and smart alternative to urban mobility, that is already being adopted in the major cities in the world. The proposed methodology consisted in the development of a decision support system that simplifies the process of choosing carsharing services. Adopting the AHP method, the user can indicate their preferences in the choice of vehicles, and the system returns an ordered list of the most suitable available vehicles based on their geographic location. The findings of the project indicate that the use of this system encourage and simplify the use of carsharing services, which will allow to enhance the financial, mobility and environment advantages inherent to their use.
